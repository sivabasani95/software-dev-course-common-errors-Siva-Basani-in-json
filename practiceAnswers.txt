Answer 1: between "checkInDate" and "checkOutDate". A comma was missing between "checkInDate": "2024-05-15" and "checkOutDate": "2024-05-20".
Why is it a problem in json? 
Answer: JSON requires commas between (key:value) pairs; missing it makes the JSON invalid.
What did you change to fix it?
Answer: Added a comma after "checkInDate": "2024-05-15",.

Question 2:what was wrong?
The first guest object has name: "Alice Johnson". 
Why is it a problem in JSON?
Answer: the key name was not quoted. JSON requires all keys to be double quoted ("") strings.
What did you change to fix it?
Answerr: I changed (name: "Alice Johnson") to "name": "Alice Johnson".


Question 3: What was wrong?
Answer: Bob Smith’s age is set as undefined
Why is it a problem in JSON?
Answer: JSON does not allow undefined as a value; only null, numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, or objects are valid.
What did you change to fix it?
Answer: I Replaced undefined with null: "age": null.



Question 4: What was wrong?
Answer: There is a trailing comma in the "amenities" array. 
Why is it a problem in JSON?
Answer: Trailing commas are not allowed in JSON arrays. JSON parsers will throw an error if an array or object ends with a comma.
What did you change to fix it?
Answer: I Removed the trailing comma: ["WiFi", "Breakfast", "Parking"].

Question 5: What was wrong?
Answer: Bob’s email is "bob.smith@example". Is this valid?
Why is it a problem in json?
Answer: Technically yes, JSON allows any string. The email format is incomplete for real world usage.
what did you change to fix it?
Answer: I was Corrected to "bob.smith@example.com".


1. What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
I mainly used JSONLint to check for syntax errors. It quickly highlighted things like missing commas, unquoted keys, and trailing commas.
I also went through the JSON manually, line by line, to spot any small mistakes that a validator might not catch, and I relied on syntax highlighting in my editor to make issues more obvious.

2️. How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
After making the fixes, I pasted the JSON back into JSONLint and it said it was valid.
I also looked over it in my code editor to make sure all the commas, quotes, and values were in the right place, just to be extra safe.

3️. Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?
The hardest ones were the unquoted key (name) and the trailing comma in the amenities array.
Both of these are small and easy to miss because they can look fine at first glance, especially if you’re scanning quickly.

4️. What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
I think the best ways to avoid these mistakes are: using JSON validators or linters regularly,
making sure syntax highlighting is on, and writing JSON by example  starting with a correct structure and copying the format. 
Also, being careful with commas and quotes and double-checking after every change really helps.
